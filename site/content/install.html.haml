  Installing rvm
First install the gem. After the gem has installed run the rvm-install script.
%pre.code
  :preserve
    $ gem install rvm            # Install the rvm gem
    $ rvm-install                # Install rvm, adds hooks for bash & zsh
    $ source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm  # load the new code into your current shell
  Note that if your gem bin directory is not in your path you will have to use the full path to the script.
  For example,
%pre.code
  :preserve
    cd ~/.gem/ruby/1.8/gem/rvm-0.0.58/ && scripts/install
%h2
  Installing directly from github repository.
%pre.code
  :preserve
    git clone git://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm.git && cd rvm && ./install

%h3
  NOTE
%p
  If rvm-install is not found it is likely because your users gem home is not in your path. You can add it to your path by putting this in your ~/.bashrc &amp; ~/.bash_profile
%pre.code
  :preserve
    ∴ cat ~/.bash_profile | grep PATH
    PATH=$PATH:~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin ; export $PATH
%p
  Alternatively you can call it manually:
%pre.code
  :preserve
    ∴ ~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin/rvm-install
    (rvm installs :) )
