<h1> Troubleshooting </h1>

<p> Here we will explore common issues and their resolutions.
  Visit me (wayneeseguin) in #rvm on irc.freenode.net and let me help you with any issues and please leave feedback!
</p>

<h2> Before trying any solution below </h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li> Make sure that you are on the latest gem version or git HEAD.  </li>
    <li> make sure that the sourcing of the rvm file occurs last in your profile files.  </li>
    <li> Be sure to be using either bash or zsh, rvm is untested at best in other shells.  </li>
</p>

<h2>After selecting a ruby, rubygems is still showing the system default.</h2>
<p>
  Most commonly this is due to RUBYOPT.
  rvm attempts to disable it during installation however you may need to manually disable RUBYOPT while installing a ruby.
  Check the ~/.rvm/log/[ruby you are installing]/rubygems.install.error.log to see if this might be the case.
</p>

<h2> My path seems empty / curl not found </h2>
<p>
  This is most often due to your environment being jacked up when you call rvm so that the wrong system defaults get recorded.
  Remove ~/.rvm/current and ~/.rvm/default*, open a new terminal shell and use rvm to select a ruby.
</p>

<h2> When in doubt... </h2>
<p>
  If all else fails 'rvm implode' then 'rvm update'
