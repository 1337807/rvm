<h1>About rvm</h1>

<p>
  Ruby Version Manager (rvm) was originally started in october of 2007, almost two years ago.
  Back then I had the idea and enthusiastically gave it a shot.
  I quickly became discouraged as is a difficult problem space.
</p>
<p>
  Since then, I have had much experience programming in bash and Ruby both.
  So I found myself last weekend now having the correct need, skill and desire in order to finally make rvm happen.
