<h1>Cut Rubies with ease...</h1>

<p>
  You want to try out all of the different ruby interpreters and versions including different patchlevels, but you don't want to break what's working for you now. 
  No time to waste?
</p> 

<p>
  Use <em><a href="/">rvm</a></em>. 
  Easy installation and switching between available Ruby versions and runtimes, without messing up your current Ruby install!
  rvm also allows you to use multiple versions of ruby in separate terminals concurrently!
<p>

<h3>Getting started is easy:</h3>

<code>
  $ gem install rvm
  # Successfully installed rvm-0.0.18
  # 1 gem installed

  $ rvm-install
  (follow prompts)

  (open new login shell)

  $ rvm use ruby -v 1.9.1
  # Switching to ruby 1.9.1  ...

  $ ruby -v
  # ruby 1.9.2dev (2009-07-18 trunk 24186) [i386-darwin10.0.0]
</code>

<h3>Going back is even easier:</h3>

<code>
  $ rvm use default
  # Switching to default   ...

  $ ruby -v  
  # ruby 1.8.7 (2008-08-11 patchlevel 72) [universal-darwin10.0]
</code>
