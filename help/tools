∴ rvm tools {identifier,path-identifier,strings,mirror,rvm-env}

Provides generic tools related to rvm environments for getting information
about your current environment. Primarily used for scripting rvm.

Examples:

To get the expanded ruby string of the current environment, we'd run:

  ∴ rvm tools identifier

To get the identifier for a folder (taking into account rvmrc files and the like),
we're instead run:

  ∴ rvm tools path-identifier ~/path/to/directory

Lastly, we can example ruby strings. E.g., to get the current ree version, we'd
run:

  ∴ rvm tools strings ree

In case of network/firewall problems it is easy to define alternate download urls:

  ∴ rvm tools mirror


It is possible to sue rvm similarly to the env shebang, you need to define the shebang wrapper:

  ∴ rvm tools rvm-env ruby bash zsh

Will define:

  /usr/bin/{ruby,bash,zsh}-rvm-env

Which can be used to initialize proper ruby using shebang:

  #!/usr/bin/ruby-rvm-env 1.9.3

And the script will be runned using ruby 1.9.3 from rvm.
