  * If you have any questions, issues and/or ideas for improvement please
    fork the project and issue a pull request.

  * If you wish to disable the project .rvmrc file functionality, set
    rvm_project_rvmrc=0 in either /etc/rvmrc or ~/.rvmrc.
    then log out and back in.

  * You _must_ read 'rvm requirements' for additional OS specific requirements for
    various rubies, and native-extension gems. Expect failures until those are met!

  * For screen users, please do not forget to read https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/workflow/screen/.
    You will need to add 'shell -${SHELL}' to your $HOME/.screenrc to properly load RVM.

  * rvm_trust_rvmrcs has been changed to rvm_trust_rvmrcs_flag for consistency

  * Project rvmrc files are now checked for trust whenever they change, as
    promised by the note displayed during the review process

  * Ruby package dependency list for your OS is given by:
      rvm requirements

  * If you encounter any issues with a ruby 'X' your best bet is to:
      rvm get head && rvm reinstall X

  * If you see the following error message: Unknown alias name: 'default'
    re-set your default ruby, this is due to a change in how default works.

  * after_use and after_cd hook now supports multiple files with after_*_*
    the custom hooks can be easily turned on/off by:
      chmod +x $rvm_path/hooks/after_cd_[hook_name]
      chmod -x $rvm_path/hooks/after_use_[hook_name]

  * If your shell exits on entering directory with freshly checked out sources
    you should update .rvmrc file, and replace any `exit ` with `return `.

  * If you wish to use RVM in an interactive fashion in other shells
    then place the following line at the end of your shell's loading files
    (.bashrc or .bash_profile for bash and .zshenv for zsh),
    after all PATH/variable settings:

    [[ -s "${rvm_scripts_path}/rvm" ]] && source "${rvm_scripts_path}/rvm"  # This loads RVM into a shell session.
