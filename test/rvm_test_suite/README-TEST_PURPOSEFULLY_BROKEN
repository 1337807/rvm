This directory will contain testing features I write in cucumber/gherkin.
NOTE: These tests are PURPOSEFULLY not working. They aren't linked to aruba
or any other testing suite on purpose. These are merely for me to textually
formulate using cucumber/gherkin as the formation of the suite.
Eventually, I DO plan on linking in several gems such as aruba. With aruba
I will need to extend its current capabilities. The *sole* purpose of this
directory is to contain feature files formalizing specific behaviour patterns
of RVM.

I'm doing this, once again, only to textually and mentally lay out and formalize
each segment of RVM's behaviours at this time. Since these are specifically for
RVM, and RVM only, I felt making this directory for storage of the *.feature files
was a good idea. This is just for storage of my renditions only!

DO NOT EXPECT THESE TO WORK!

UPDATE: Currently, I've reworked everything in Ruby. The ruby sub-directory here
contains what I think should be a good way to track systems, commands, returned
test data, and generate reports. The basic idea is to use the test nodes' system
ruby to execute the test scripts intially, and then use rvm itself for consecutive
test runs. The data trapped is the system name, the command executed, and the
output of that command. The tables also have a .id field as well like one would
expect in a Rails application though we're not using rails here.

Right now the current rendition does not display the command output as its command
is executed, it merely traps it in the variable and stores it in the database.
The command output you do see comes from the report itself. The 'report' needs to
be moved to its own action within the Command model or a Report model created.
I personally prefer the creation of a Report'ing model.

I'm also thinking I'd like to set it up so that you scp a .gz to the test nodes,
and script it so that a cronjob is injected onto each node for scheduling.
Then once the tests are complete and the data recorded, delete the directories
and script(s) from the nodes. I'd like to use the .id field for directory name.

Self PS: Need to find any additional gems for testing shell scripts in addition
to aruba.
