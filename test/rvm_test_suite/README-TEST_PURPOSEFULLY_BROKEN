This directory will contain testing features I write in cucumber/gherkin.
NOTE: These tests are PURPOSEFULLY not working. They aren't linked to aruba
or any other testing suite on purpose. These are merely for me to textually
formulate using cucumber/gherkin as the formation of the suite.
Eventually, I DO plan on linking in several gems such as aruba. With aruba
I will need to extend its current capabilities. The *sole* purpose of this
directory is to contain feature files formalizing specific behaviour patterns
of RVM.

I'm doing this, once again, only to textually and mentally lay out and formalize
each segment of RVM's behaviours at this time. Since these are specifically for
RVM, and RVM only, I felt making this directory for storage of the *.feature files
was a good idea. This is just for storage of my renditions only!

DO NOT EXPECT THESE TO WORK!

Self PS: Need to find any additional gems for testing shell scripts in addition
to aruba.
